						<i>
							Trusts are containers for assets. You place what you own inside and the lid may only be opened according to your rules. They are designed to protect your assets from creditors. Our trusts are formed domestically and avoid many pitfalls common to offshore trusts. As proud members of the Domestic Asset Protection Counsel we are happy to walk you through the process.

						<i>
							Medicaid costs often force families to go bankrupt caring for their elders. One month in a skillerd nursing facility costs an average of $10,000. Our trusts enable you to qualify for Medicaid, without losing your home or going bankrupt - for less than the cost of one month in a nursing facility.
